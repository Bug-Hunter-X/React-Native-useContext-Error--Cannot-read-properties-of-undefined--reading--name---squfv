To solve this, ensure that the component using `useContext` is rendered within a component that provides the context using `<MyContext.Provider>`.

```javascript
//Correct Usage (test file)
import { MyComponent } from './MyComponent';
import { render } from '@testing-library/react-native';
import MyContextProvider from './MyContext';

describe('MyComponent', () => {
it('renders correctly', () => {
  render(
    <MyContextProvider>
      <MyComponent/>
    </MyContextProvider>
  );
});
});
```

Alternatively, you can adjust your component structure to ensure that the context is always available before the component that uses the context is mounted. This would involved refactoring to wrap components appropriately.  The solution here provides a quick test and illustration for context.

Make sure `MyContextProvider` is properly implemented and placed in your component hierarchy to provide the needed context value.
